# NiceIO
For when you've had to use System.IO one time too many.

I need to make c# juggle files & directories around a lot. It has to work on osx, linux and windows. It always hurts, and I've never enjoyed it.
NiceIO is an attempt to fix that. It's a single file library. no binaries, no .csproj's, no nuget specs, none of that.
Whenever dealing with files makes you cringe, just grab NiceIO.cs, throw it in your project and get on with your business.

This project is in a very early state and the API is very far from stable.

NiceIO is MIT Licensed.
